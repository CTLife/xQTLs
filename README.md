# xQTLs
Scripts for molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis.                               
All Perl, Python, R, and Bash Shell scripts were used to eQTLs and RNA-m6A QTLs analysis by integrating [QTLtools](https://github.com/qtltools/qtltools) and [MASH](https://github.com/stephenslab/mashr).
    
# Steps:     
1. Quantify reads density from ChIP-seq or MeRIP-seq data by [1a_QTLtools_quan.peaks.pl], or gene expression level from RNA-seq data by [1b_QTLtools_quan.gene.pl]
